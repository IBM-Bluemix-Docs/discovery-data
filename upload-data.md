# Uploading data
{: #upload-data}

You can perform a one-time document upload from your local file system at any time to add data to a project.
{: shortdesc}

You can upload up to 200 files at a time. The maximum size allowed for each file is 32 MB.

To process document sets that are larger than 200 files, add them to an external data source and use a data source crawler to upload them. For {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull_notm}} deployments, you can use a *Local File System* data source for this purpose.

Before you upload a CSV file to a Content Mining project, decide whether you want to apply enrichments to the content. If so, consider adding headers to the source file so that any fields that are generated have meaningful names. Without headers, fields are given generic names, such as `column_0`, `column_1`, and so on.
{: tip}

To upload data, complete the following steps:

1.  Open your project, go to the **Manage collections** page, and then click **New collection**.
1.  Choose **Upload data** as your data source.

    The file size limit for uploading data is 32 MB.
    {: note}

1.  Optionally, click **More processing settings** to expand the menu, and then click **Apply optical character recognition (OCR)**. 

    By default, this option is set to **Off**. If you set it to **On**, {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} extracts text from images, by using optical character recognition. When OCR is enabled and your documents contain images, processing takes longer.

1.  Browse for the files you want to crawl.

    ![IBM Cloud only](images/ibm-cloud.png) **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}**: You can drag documents that you want to add to your collection.

The file upload is completed quickly. It takes more time for the data to be processed as it is added to the collection. After the files are uploaded and processed, the Activity page shows the upload results.

## Supported file types
{: #supportedfiletypes}

{{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} can ingest specific file types. For all other types of files, a warning message is displayed and the file is not ingested. 

The following table shows the supported file types and information about feature support that varies by file type.

| Supported file type | Use Smart Document Understanding to identify fields | Enable OCR to extract text from images |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Contract (written in any supported file type) | A pretrained SDU model is applied automatically | ![checkmark icon](../../icons/checkmark-icon.svg) (Enabled by default) |

{: row-headers}
{: class="comparison-table"}
{: caption="Supported file types" caption-side="top"}
{: summary="This table has row and column headers. The row headers identify supported file types. The column headers identify different product features. To understand which features are available for a file type, go to the row that describes the document type, and find the columns for the feature you are interested in."}
    
Files within compressed archive files (ZIP, GZIP, TAR) are extracted. Discovery ingests the supported file types within the archive; it ignores all other file types. Discovery supports MacOS ZIP files only if they are generated by using a command such as: `zip -r my-folder.zip my-folder -x "*.DS_Store"`. ZIP files that are created by right-clicking a folder and clicking *Compress* are not supported.
