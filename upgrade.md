## Upgrading your plan
{: #upgrade-plan}

You can explore the {{site.data.keyword.discoveryshort}} [service plan options](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-discovery/pricing-2/){: external} to decide which plan is best for you.

The page header shows the plan you are using today.

![Shows that the Trial plan is displayed in the page header](images/plan-in-header.png)

You cannot upgrade from a Lite (v1) plan to a Plus (v2) plan. And you cannot upgrade from an Advanced (v1) plan to a Premium (v2) plan. To start using v2, create a new Plus or Premium plan. For more information about the Lite and Advanced plans, see the [v1 pricing plans documentation](/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-discovery-pricing-plans){: external}.

1.  How you upgrade depends on your plan.

    - If you decide you want to keep the Plus plan after using the 30-day free trial, no action is required.

      The Plus Trial is converted to a Plus plan automatically and you are charged monthly. If you decide you do not want to continue using the Plus plan, delete the Plus plan service instance before the 30-day trial period ends. You can delete the service instance from the [IBM Cloud Resource list](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources){: external}.

      The number of days that are left in your trial is displayed in the page header.

    - You cannot do an in-place upgrade from a Plus plan to a Premium plan.

      A Premium plan instance must be provisioned for you. To start the process, [create a new resource](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-discovery){: external} and choose the Premium plan option.

For answers to common questions about subscriptions, see the [How you're charged](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges){: external}.
