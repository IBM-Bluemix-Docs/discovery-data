# Discovery pricing plans
{: #pricing-plans}

<!-- Learn more topic WDS -->
Learn more about the {{site.data.keyword.discoveryfull}} service plans, so you can pick the plan type that best meets your needs.
{: shortdesc}

## Plus
{: #plusplan}

Find targeted answers and insights across many document types. 

The first Plus plan created includes a 30-day free trial.
Each additional Plus plan (and use of the first plan after 30 days) costs $500 per month.

If you continue to use a Plus Trial service instance after the 30-day trial ends, the plan is converted to a Plus plan and you are charged a monthly fee. To avoid being charged after 30 days, delete the Plus plan service instance.
